### Playfair Cypher

This project goes back to the simpler times of creating secret codes as kids.

The [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) is a method of encrypting a message by hand using a keyword and a 5x5 table of non-repeating characters.

It is encrypted by keyword, thus can only be decrypted by the same keyword.
